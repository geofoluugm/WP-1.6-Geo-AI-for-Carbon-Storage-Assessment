# Indonesiaâ€™s FOLU Net Sink 2030 â€“ WP 1.6: Geo-AI for Carbon Storage Assessment

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is part of Indonesiaâ€™s FOLU Net Sink 2030 â€“ IP UGM WP 2.6, focusing on Geo-AI Development and Use-case for Carbon Storage Assessment.
We develop a Geo-AI modeling system to support carbon stock assessment, following the IPCC Tier 2 and Tier 3 standards (medium- and detail-scale).

The study area is located in Sepaku Watershed, East Kalimantan, with a specific focus on Wanagama Forest in IKN (Nusantara Capital City).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Develop models for Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) at both medium and detail scales.
- Integrate remote sensing data (LiDAR, Sentinel, PlanetScope) with field forest inventory.
- Produce models using shallow learning and deep learning for carbon stock analysis.

## ðŸ§© Sub-Activities
This project consists of four main sub-activities:

**1. Detail-scale AGB modeling**
- Data: UAV LiDAR + Forest Inventory
- Method: Shallow Learning & Deep Learning /n
**2. Medium-scale AGB modeling**
- Data: LiDAR GEDI + Sentinel-1 + Sentinel-2
- Method: Shallow Learning & Deep Learning /n
**3. Detail-scale LULC modeling**
- Data: PlanetScope
- Method: Shallow Learning & Deep Learning /n
**4. Medium-scale LULC modeling**
- Data: Benchmark Open Sentinel Map
- Method: Shallow Learning & Deep Learning
